        <h2>What is JS?</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a dynamic, lightweight, interpreted programming language primarily used for creating interactive web pages, supporting both client-side and server-side development, and featuring dynamic typing,
        <br> object-oriented capabilities, and asynchronous operations through event loops and callbacks.</p>
        <pre>
        Key Characteristics of JavaScript:
         - High-Level Language: Abstracts away many low-level details, making it easier to write code.
         - Interpreted: Code is executed directly without needing to compile it into machine code first.
         - Multi-Paradigm: Supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming styles.
         - Dynamic: Variables are dynamically typed, meaning their types are determined at runtime.
         - Event-Driven: Ideal for handling user interactions and asynchronous operations.
